Challenge Instructions
----------------------

Now that you have signed up for the competition at www.datasciencecapstone.org and explored the training data, it's time to build a machine learning model and test it with the Test set values dataset.

You can use your tool of preference to generate and test a model, including Azure Machine Learning, R, SciKit-Learn in Python, or Spark.

To enter a submission for the competition, you must use your model to predict labels for the observations in the Test set values dataset, and then submit your results in the prescribed Submission format. Make sure you read the competition details and rules at www.datasciencecapstone.org carefully.

Each time you submit an entry, it is scored using the test set to determine your place on the competition leaderboard. It is also scored using a private test set to which you do not have access in order to ensure your model is not over-fitted to the public test data. Your score is calculated based on an appropriate performance metric for the type of model you need to create, and this is translated into a grade for the challenge.

Important: When you submit your entry, you will be given a unique token. You must enter this token in the following page in order to receive the grade for your submission in this edX course. You can enter tokens for subsequent entries, and your highest scoring entry will be counted as 50% of your final overall grade for this course.
