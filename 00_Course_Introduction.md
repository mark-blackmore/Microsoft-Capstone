About This Course
-----------------

Welcome to DAT102x: Data Science Professional Project. We're very excited to have you participate in this capstone project for the Microsoft Professional Program for data science.

This course is unusual, in that it is primarily a self-paced project that consists of a series of challenges in which you will put your data science skills to the test. To get started, view the Course page and view the topics in the Introduction section, which will describe the challenges you will be working on.

The course will run for four weeks, with a new challenge each week. In the final week of the course, you must participate in peer review of your fellow students' work in order to receive your own grade. You have until the stated deadlines for each challenge to complete all graded coursework. Note that all dates and times are shown in the UTC time zone, which is the time in London during the winter months. You can find out when this is in your local timezone at <http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx>.

We welcome your feedback, so if something is confusing or doesn't work the way you expect, let us know and we'll do our best to address it. Please use the Discussion page to introduce yourself and let us know how you're doing. The course is self-paced, so while staff will periodically check the discussion forums, you are expected to work through the materials and submit the graded assignments at your own pace. With so many students taking the course, it will be impossible for staff to answer every question individually; so please use the discussion forums to share questions and comments with your fellow students - the chances are, someone else taking the course will have encountered and resolved the issue you are having!

To pass this project, you must achieve an overall grade of 70% or more.

Again, welcome and thanks for taking this course from Microsoft.
